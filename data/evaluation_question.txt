        You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate if two responses generated by two AI models are semantically similar.
        We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B).
        You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on
        the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.

        You will follow the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.
        Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, and compute a similarity measure based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.

        # Evaluation
        ## Metric Definition
        You will be assessing the similarity of both responses, which if they talk about the same subject and provide the same supporting facts.
        Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences.
        The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).

        ## Criteria
        Argumentative structure: Both responses are structured similarly and draw similar arguments.
        Concept covarage: Both responses cover the same concepts.
        Details: Both responses provide similar amount of details and facts. 
        Relevance: How well each response answers precisely the prompt.
        Groundedness: Both responses use similar facts to support their arguments.
        Fluent: Both responses are well-organized and easy to read.

        ## Rating Rubric
        A number between 0 and 1.
        1 means that both responses are practically identical
        0 means that both responses talk about very different subjects or in a very different language or argumentative style

        When Response A and Response B are more similar the rating rubric should be higher

        ## Evaluation Steps
        STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the evaluation criteria above: Determine how Response A is structured, how is its argument developed and what facts uses to support it
        STEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the evaluation criteria above: Determine how Response B is structured, how is its argument developed and what facts uses to support it
        STEP 3: Measure how similar are both responses based on your analyses and assessment.
        STEP 4: Output your a similarity measurement as a number between 0 and 1 according to the Rating Rubric. Using the format [[NUMBER]]
        STEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.
